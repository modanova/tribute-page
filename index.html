        <p><u>Emily Jean "Emma" Stone</u> is an American actress. She is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Golden Globe Award. In 2017, she was the world's highest-paid actress and named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>
        <p><u>Why her</u>. Emma Stone has played in many movies I like. But the one especially that I value the most is 'La La Land'. The soundtrack is magical and brings many personal precious moments such as my wedding. Especially the famous one - 'City of Stars'.

        <p><u>More</u>. Emma Stone played a recovering drug addict in the black comedy Birdman (2014), which earned her more nominations. Musical Cabaret followed, which lead to her performance as an aspiring actress in the romantic musical 'La La Land'. Stone won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. After a leading role a Netflix miniseries, she reduced her workload, starring in only a few films. Stone is married to comedian and writer Dave McCary, with whom she has a daughter.</p>
